## Description

This project, developed during the Microprocessors Laboratory course in 2021, is an IoT-based system designed for collecting and processing environmental data. The key features include:

- **Data Collection:** Utilized thermal and moisture sensors to collect environmental data.

- **Data Processing and Transmission:** Processed and transmitted data through intermediate nodes.

- **Main Node Control:** Designed a main node responsible for controlling watering pots in areas with suitable environmental conditions.

- **Simulation:** Simulated all nodes using AVR microcontrollers.

- **Communication:** Established robust communication using ESPs.
